Personal Portfolio, Frontend Development
In this project I made a personal portfolio with the help of BootStrap. From this project I learnt to:

1. Add interactivity to web pages with JavaScript.
2. Describe the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).
3. Use the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify pages.
4. Apply responsive design to enable page to be viewed by various devices.
