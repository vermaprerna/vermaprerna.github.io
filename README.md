In this project I made a personal portfolio with the help of BootStrap. From this project I learnt to:
–	Add interactivity to web pages with JavaScript.
–	Describe the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).
–	Use the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify pages.
–	Apply responsive design to enable page to be viewed by various devices.
